# Requirement 2 â€“ forward and backward moves
Now that we know where our ship is, let's try to move it. To begin with, we should be able
to go both forwards and backwards.
- Implement commands that move the ship forwards and backwards (f and b).

The Location helper class already has the forward and backward methods that implement this functionality:
```java
public boolean forward() {
   ...
}
```
